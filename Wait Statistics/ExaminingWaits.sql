/*

Wait Types Explanation:

- CXPACKET:
  + Parallel operations are taking place
  + Accumulating very fast implies skewed work distribution amongst threads or one of the workers is being blocked by something
  + Correlation with PAGEIOLATCH_SH waits? Implies large scans

- PAGEIOLATCH_XX:
  + Waiting for a data file page to be read from disk into memory
  + Common modes to see are SH and EX
    - SH mode means the page will be read
    - EX mode means the page will be changed
  + Correlate with CXPACKET waits, suggesting parallel scans

- ASYNC_NETWORK_IO:
  + SQL Server is waiting for a client to acknowledge receipt of sent data
  + Analyze client application code. Nearly always a poorly-coded application that is processing results one
    record at a time (RBAR = Row-By-Agonizing-Row)
  + Analyze network latencies
