Trouble Shooting Scenarios:

 - WHERE: AND (qs.max_elapsed_time > 28000000) -- identify potential timeout statements.
 - WHERE: AND (qs.total_worker_time > qs.total_elapsed_time) -- identify potential parallel statements

 - ORDER BY qs.execution_count DESC -- statements are called the most often
 - ORDER BY [avg_elapsed_time_seconds] DESC -- long-running statements
 - ORDER BY [avg_worker_time_seconds] DESC -- the most expensive statements from a CPU perspective
 - ORDER BY [avg_logical_reads] DESC -- the most expensive statements from a memory perspective 
 - ORDER BY [avg_physical_reads] DESC -- the most expensive statements from a read I/O perspective
 - ORDER BY [avg_logical_writes] DESC -- the most expensive statements from a write I/O perspective
 - ORDER BY [Avg IO] DESC -- the most expensive statements from I/O perspective
